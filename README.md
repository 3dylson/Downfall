# Downfall Game:
This game is an N player game (N >= 2, and is an arbitrarily large integer). It consists of a vertical board of N sides. There are dials built into the board. The dials can be seen on all sides of the board. If a dial is rotated, all of its sides rotate together. There are slots on the edges of the dials. The number of slots and the positions of the slots may be different on different sides of the same dial.

Each player starts with some numbered tokens or discs at the top of the board. A single token fits exactly into a single slot. When the slots of two touching dials are aligned, the token from the higher slot falls into the lower slot.

The objective of the game is to move the discs to the bottom of the board by turning the dials. Players alternate turns moving the dials, and cannot move the dial that the previous player has just moved. The player on turn can rotate the selected dial to any position they want, even in multiple directions and even multiple times. The winner is the first player to move all of their discs into the tray at the bottom. The discs must arrive in the tray in their numerical order.

Since neither player can see the other's board, it is common to inadvertently advance - or hinder - the opponent's gameplay. The game rewards forward thinking and planning; players may try to "trap" their opponents into turning a dial that will advance their own disc, while trying to ensure that their own discs are not caught and dropped out of order.
